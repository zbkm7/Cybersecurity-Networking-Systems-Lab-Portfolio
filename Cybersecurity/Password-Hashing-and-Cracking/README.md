# Password Hashing & Cracking Lab (Python)

This project explores secure password storage mechanisms and demonstrates why modern hashing algorithms with salting and key stretching are critical for protecting user credentials.

## Overview
Using Python, I implemented and tested password hashing and brute-force cracking techniques to compare plaintext, unsalted hashes, and salted hashes using PBKDF2.

## Topics Covered
- Password hashing fundamentals
- Salted vs unsalted hashes
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- Brute-force password cracking
- Performance and scalability analysis
- Secure authentication design principles

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- hashlib (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256)
- Virtual environments
- Command-line execution

## Artifacts
- Password cracking scripts
- Hashed and salted datasets
- Execution output and timing results
- Written analysis and conclusions

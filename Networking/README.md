# Networking Labs & Traffic Analysis

This folder contains hands-on networking labs focused on packet analysis, routing behavior, and network troubleshooting using real traffic captures and diagnostic tools.

## Topics Covered
- Packet capture and inspection (Wireshark)
- ICMP behavior and traceroute analysis
- TCP/UDP communication patterns
- Network latency and hop-by-hop routing
- DNS and HTTP traffic inspection
- Routing tables and gateway metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark
- ICMP / TCP / UDP
- Windows & Linux networking tools
- Virtualized lab environments

## Lab Structure
Each subfolder contains:
- A brief README explaining the lab
- Screenshots or packet captures
- Supporting documentation or analysis

These labs demonstrate practical understanding of how data moves across networks and how to analyze traffic during troubleshooting and security investigations.

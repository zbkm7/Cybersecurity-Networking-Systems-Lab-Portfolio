# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

This project documents hands-on network traffic analysis performed using Wireshark to understand packet-level behavior, protocol interactions, and troubleshooting techniques.

## Overview
The labs focused on capturing and analyzing live network traffic to observe how data moves across a network, how protocols behave, and how issues can be identified through packet inspection.

## Topics Explored
- ICMP echo requests and replies (ping analysis)
- TCP three-way handshake
- Packet timing and latency
- DNS query and response behavior
- HTTP request and response traffic
- Routing paths and hop-by-hop analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark
- ICMP / TCP / UDP
- DNS / HTTP
- Windows networking utilities

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network troubleshooting
- Packet analysis
- Protocol identification
- Root-cause analysis
- Traffic inspection for security and performance

## Artifacts
- Packet capture screenshots
- Annotated traffic analysis
- Supporting documentation

## What This Demonstrates

These labs collectively demonstrate hands-on experience with network traffic analysis using Wireshark, including:

- Packet capture and inspection
- ICMP, TCP, DNS, and HTTP protocol analysis
- Identification of suspicious and malicious traffic
- Applying packet analysis to answer investigative questions

This folder consolidates multiple academic labs into a single portfolio project.
